# ECEN4933_final_project
This is collection of code from ECEN 4933 Final Project. The code is split by project check-in milestones.


Check-in 1: 
Goals:
1) Find plasmid BioBrick parts that make up complete plasmid assembly.
2) Create an SBOL plasmid part.
3) Add the child BioBrick parts of plasmid as subcomponents to SBOL plasmid part. Must check for redundancies in subcomponents before adding.
